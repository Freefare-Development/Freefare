## Our approach to solving the problem
The aim of SurPlusPlus is to reduce food waste and other surplus resources, such as clothing, groceries, etc. by connecting grocery stores and other reatailers, food providers, such as corporations, hotels, events and catering, with those in need, such as food pantries, shelters, direct consumers, etc.
