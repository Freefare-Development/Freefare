            There are tons of food-waste websites, but still tons of hungry people who don't know about them.

            We (Wisdom and Justo) started this before the pandemic as a way for us hungry college grads to find free food.
            <br><br> 
            Once it hit, we realized that there was tons of demand for free food, plenty of places that provided it, 
            but still tons of hungry people. Almost needless to say, our project became even more important. 
            <br><br>
            We realized that the focus of "food-waste" initiatives ought to be incentivizing people who need free food the most to
            find it, rather than finding ways to get rid the guilt of businesses with excess food by finding anyone who can take it.
            We focus on the other side of the food-waste coin: actually finding free food.
            <h5 class="center-block" style="margin: 30pt; word-spacing: 2pt; ">
            Freefare is a project born from two broke quasi-yuppies trying to find free food events, but realized there 
            were people who needed it more than us.

            But when the pandemic hit, we still had our jobs and could afford food. 
            But many others didn’t, and couldn’t.
            <br><br>
            The supply and demand mismatches we witnessed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic inspired us to take the project more seriously. 
            There were people in downtown Hartford begging for food only 500 feet away from a church that was giving it away. 
            While restaurants, farms and groceries were initially left with excess produce, 
            many pantries and soup kitchens found themselves running bare trying to feed the newly jobless and hungry. 
            The supply and demand for free food was there, but nobody really knew where. 
            <br><br>
            From there, we've gone through waves of sprints and procrastination until this most recent rebrand.
            Now, a different side of the same coin; instead of focusing on eliminating food-waste, our goal is to make sure a user always knows where to find free food.
            If pantries, churches, and restaurants giving away free food can't give it away, it goes to waste. 
            On the other hand, if everyone who could use free food and is hungry has been fed, people who have free food have done their best.
            <br><br>   
            We hope to start to address the fundamental misallocation of excess food by providing a focused and curated place to share it. Thank you for coming along with us on this journey!
