          Freefare is a project born from the persistent hate for food waste
          that brought us together. We first started Freefare as a way for us --
          then, two lonely and hungry recent college grads --, to find free food
          around our area. But when the pandemic hit, we still had our jobs and
          could afford food. But many others didn’t, and couldn’t.
          <br><br>
          The supply and demand mismatches we witnessed at the beginning of the
          Covid-19 pandemic inspired us to take the project more seriously.
          There were people in downtown Hartford begging for food only 500 feet
          away from a church that was giving it away. While restaurants, farms
          and groceries were initially left with excess produce, many pantries
          and soup kitchens found themselves running bare trying to feed the
          newly jobless and hungry. The supply and demand for free food was
          there, but nobody really knew where.
